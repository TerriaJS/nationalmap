Change Log
==========

### 2015-12-15

* Fixed the squished images on the Related Maps panel.

### 2015-11-16

* Completely support the [csv-geo-au](https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au) specification (other than SA1s and boundaries from previous years) including ASGS boundaries like remoteness regions, indigenous areas and non ASGS boundaries like primary health networks.
* Added freight route datasets provided by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development under `Transport -> Freight`.
* Added IMOS and AODN Geoservers to the list of hosts that may be proxied.
* Changed the support email address from `nationalmap@communications.gov.au` to `data@pmc.gov.au`.
* Use YouTube videos hosted in the AusGovDPMC account.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.48.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Update the default Australian topography basemap to Geoscience Australia's new worldwide layer (http://www.ga.gov.au/gisimg/rest/services/topography/National_Map_Colour_Basemap/MapServer)
  * The Feature Info panel now shows all selected features in an accordion control.  Previously it only showed the first one.
  * Major refactor of `CsvCatalogItem`, splitting region-mapping functionality out into `RegionProvider` and `RegionProviderList`. Dozens of new test cases. In the process, fixed a number of bugs and added new features including:
    * Regions can be matched using regular expressions, enabling matching of messy fields like local government names ("Baw Baw", "Baw Baw Shire", "Baw Baw (S)", "Shire of Baw Baw" etc).
    * Regions can be matched using a second field for disambiguation (eg, "Campbelltown" + "SA")
    * Drag-and-dropped datasets with a time column behave much better: rather than a fixed time being allocated to each row, each row occupies all the time up until the next row is shown.
    * Enumerated fields are colour coded in lat-long files, consist with region-mapped files.
    * Feedback is now provided after region mapping, showing which regions failed to match, and which matched more than once.
    * Bug: Fields with names starting with 'lon', 'lat' etc were too aggressively matched.
    * Bug: Numeric codes beginning with zeros (eg, certain NT 08xx postcodes) were treated as numbers and failed to match.
    * Bug: Fields with names that could be interpreted as regions weren't available as data variables.
  * The `LocationBarViewModel` now shows the latitude and longitude coordinates of the mouse cursor in 2D as well as 3D.
  * The `LocationBarViewModel` no longer displays a misleading elevation of 0m when in "3D Smooth" mode.
  * Applied markdown to properties shown in the Feature Info Panel.
  * HTML and Markdown text in catalog item metadata, feature information, etc. is now formatted in a more typical way.  For example, text inside `<h1>` now looks like a heading.  Previously, most HTML styling was stripped out.
  * The `name` of a feature from a CSV file is now taken from a `name` or `title` column, if it exists.  Previously the name was always "Site Data".
  * Most catalog items now automatically expose a `dataUrl` that is the same as their `url`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused time-dynamic WMS layers with just one time to not be displayed.
  * Underscores are now replaced with spaces in the feature info panel for `GeoJsonCatalogItem`.
  * Added Proj4 projections to the location bar. Clicking on the bar switches between lats/longs and projected coordinates. To enable this, set `useProjection` to `true`
  * Fixed a bug that caused an exception when running inside an `<iframe>` and the user's browser blocked 3rd-party cookies.
  * Fixed a bug that caused `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` to incorrectly populate the catalog item's metadata with data from GetCapabilities when another layer had a `Title` with the same value as the expected layer's `Name`.
  * Avoid mixed content warnings when using the CartoDB basemaps.
  * Handle WMS time interval specifications (time/time and time/time/periodicity)
  * Allow a single layer of an ArcGIS MapServer to be added through the "Add Data" interface.
  * Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.15.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
    * Make KML invalid coordinate processing match Google Earth behavior. [#3124](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3124)
    * Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2271)
    * Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2271)
    * Provided a workaround for Safari 9 where WebGL constants can't be accessed through `WebGLRenderingContext`. Now constants are hard-coded in `WebGLConstants`. [#2989](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2989)
    * Added a workaround for Chrome 45, where the first character in a label with a small font size would not appear. [#3011](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3011)
    * Fixed an issue with drill picking at low frame rates that would cause a crash. [#3010](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3010)

### 2015-10-15

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.44.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that could cause timeseries animation to "jump" when resuming play after it was paused.
  * When catalog items are enabled, the checkbox now animates to indicate that loading is in progress.
  * Add `mode=preview` option in the hash portion of the URL.  When present, it is assumed that TerriaJS is being used as a previewer and the "small screen warning" will not be shown.
  * Added the `attribution` property to catalog items.  The attribution is displayed on the map when the catalog item is enabled.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented `AbsIttCatalogGroup` from successfully loading its list of catalog items.
  * Allow missing URLs on embedded data (eg. embedded czml data)
  * Fixed a bug loading URLs for ArcGIS services names that start with a number.
* Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.13.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * The default `CTRL + Left Click Drag` mouse behavior is now duplicated for `CTRL + Right Click Drag` for better compatibility with Firefox on Mac OS [#2913](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/2913).
  * Fixed an issue where non-feature nodes prevented KML documents from loading. [#2945](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/2945)

### 2015-09-17

* Improved proxy cache expiration.  Previously, catalog item tiles could be cached by end-user browsers much longer than intended.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.43.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the opened/closed state of groups from being preserved when sharing.

  * Added `CswCatalogGroup` for populating a catalog by querying an OGC CSW service.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented WMTS layers with a single `TileMatrixSetLink` from working correctly.
  * Added support for WMTS layers that can only provide tiles in JPEG format.
  * Fixed testing and caching of ArcGIS layers from tools and added More information option for imagery layers.
  * Made polygons drastically faster in 2D.
  * Added Google Analytics reporting of the application URL.  This is useful for tracking use of share URLs.
  * Added the ability to specify a specific dynamic layer of an ArcGIS Server using just a URL.
  * Fixed a race condition in `AbsIttCatalogItem` that could cause the legend and map to show different state than the Now Viewing UI suggested.
  * Fixed a bug where an ABS concept with a comma in its name (e.g. "South Eastern Europe,nfd(c)" in Country of Birth) would cause values for concept that follow to be misappropriated to the wrong concepts.
  * `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` now shows "NoData" tiles by default even after showing the popup message saying that max zoom is exceeded.  This can be disabled by setting its `showTilesAfterMessage` property to false.

### 2015-07-19

  * Added layer information to the Info popup for WMS datasets.
  * Polygons from GeoJSON datasets are now filled.
  * Left-aligned feature info table column and added some space between columns.
  * Added support for styling GeoJSON files, either in catalog (add .style{} object) or embedded directly in the file following the [SimpleStyle spec](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented catalog items inside groups on the Search tab from being enabled.

  * Upgraded to Cesium 1.11.

### 2015-07-03

* Changed the support email address from `nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au` to `nationalmap@communications.gov.au`.
* Renamed "Gravity Image" to "Gravity Anomaly" and updated it to load from the new server (the old one is deprecated).
* Renamed "Magnetic Image" to "Magnetic Intensity" and updated it to load from the new server (the old one is deprecated).
* Updated the layer name used to access "SRTM 1 sec DEM Image".  The old one worked but was not advertised in the WMS server's GetCapabilities, which limited the quality of the metadata.
* The Data.gov.au group now includes CKAN resources with the `csv-geo-au` format.
* Improved the metadata, including descriptions and licence information, for many of the data sets in National Data Sets.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.32.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Numerous changes to improve the quality of the catalogue item info page.
  * Added support for `csv-geo-*` (e.g. csv-geo-au) to `CkanCatalogGroup`.
  * `CkanCatalogGroup` now fills the `dataUrl` property of created items by pointing to the dataset's page on CKAN.

  * An empty `description` or `info` section is no longer shown on the catalog item information panel.  This can be used to remove sections that would otherwise be populated from dataset metadata.

### 2015-06-24

* Updated the favicon.
* Switched the new Medicare Offices dataset to load directly from data.gov.au.

### 2015-06-23

* Added "Medicare Offices" dataset under Social and Economic.
* Fixed the URL of the Roboto Mono font so that it downloads correctly even over `https`.
* Improved the styling of the About page.
* Fixed an incorrect link to the About page from the disclaimer at the bottom of the map.
* The nm.json file is now created at build time from a number of initialization files in the `datasources` directory.  The individual files are easier to manage and edit than a single large file.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.27.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed incorrect date formatting in the timeline and animation controls on Internet Explorer 9.
  * Added support for CSV files with longitude and latitude columns but no numeric value column.  Such datasets are visualized as points with a default color and do not have a legend.
  * The Feature Information popup is now automatically closed when the user changes the `AbsIttCatalogItem` filter.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now determines its rectangle from the GetCapabilities metadata even when configured to use multiple WMS layers.
  * `AbsIttCatalogItem` styles can now be set using the `tableStyle` property, much like `CsvCatalogItem`.
  * Improved `AbsIttCatalogItem`'s tolerance of errors from the server.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the brand bar to slide away with the explorer panel on Internet Explorer 9.

### 2015-06-16

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.23.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented features from being pickable from ABS datasets on the 2D map.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the Explorer Panel tabs to be missing or misaligned in Firefox.
  * Changed to use JPEG instead of PNG format for the Natural Earth II basemap.  This makes the tile download substantially smaller.

  * Added the ability to add an entire ArcGIS Server to the catalogue using the Add Data panel.
  * Improved the capabilities of the hidden Tools panel, accessed by appending `#tools=1` to the URL and clicking the Tools button.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the 2D / 3D buttons the Maps menu to get out of sync with the actual state of the map after switching automatically to 2D due to a performance problem.
  * Added support for connecting to Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) servers.

### 2015-05-28

* To hide the Explorer Panel at startup, the url can contain the parameter `hideEplorerPanel=1`.
* Upgraded to [TerriaJS 1.0.15](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/blob/1.0.15/CHANGES.md).  Significant changes relevant to National Map users include:
  * Esri ArcGIS MapServers can now be added via the "Add Data" panel.
  * We now support discovery of ArcGIS MapServer "Raster Layers" in addition to "Feature Layers".
  * Sharing now preserves the base map and view mode (2D/3D) selection.
  * Improved error handling in `CzmlCatalogItem`, `GeoJsonCatalogItem`, and `KmlCatalogItem`.
  * We now raise an error and hide the dataset when asked to show a layer in Leaflet and that layer does not use the Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection. Previously, the dataset would silently fail to display.
  * Fixed a bug that caused Internet Explorer 8 users to see a blank page instead of a message saying their browser is incompatible.

### 2015-05-15

* Dataset changes:
  * Added New South Wales Government
  * Added National Data Sets -> Surface Water -> Water Observations from Space

See the [changelog](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/blob/1.0.11/CHANGES.md) for the complete list of changes since TerriaJS split off from National Map.  Significant changes relevant to National Map users include:
  * The Search tab now searches the names of all datasets in the catalogue, including those in delay-loaded groups.
  * The 2D view once again correctly shows imagery attribution.
  * The catalog item info page now renders a much more complete set of Markdown and HTML elements.
  * Added support for region mapping based on region names instead of region numbers (example in `wwwroot/test/countries.csv`).
  * Added support for time-dynamic region mapping (example in `wwwroot/test/droughts.csv`).
  * Added the ability to region-map countries (example in `wwwroot/test/countries.csv`).
  * Esri ArcGIS MapServer datasets now show much more information when the user clicks the Info button.
  * Improved the appearance of the legends generating with region mapping.
  * Fixed a bug that caused features to be picked from all layers in an Esri MapServer, instead of just the visible ones.
  * Added support for the WMS MinScaleDenominator property and the Esri MapServer maxScale property, preventing layers using these properties from disappearing when zoomed in to close to the surface.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the "Drop a data file anywhere" message to get stuck on when dragging a file over the application while a modal dialog was open.
  * Elminated distracting "jumping" of the selection indicator when picking point features while zoomed in very close to the surface.
  * The 3D viewer now shows Bing Maps imagery unmodified, matching the 2D viewer. Previously, it applied a gamma correction.
  * Polygons loaded from KML files are now placed on the terrain surface.
  * We no longer automatically fly to the first location when pressing Enter in the Search input box, because this was surprising and often didn't work well.
  * Checkboxes in the Data Catalogue and Search tabs now have a larger clickable area, which is especially helpful on touch screens.
  * The Feature Information functionality now works with servers that can only return HTML, and displays it appropriately.  This is especially useful for Google Maps Engine (GME) WMS servers.
* The Bing Maps API key can now be specified in config.json.

### 2015-04-15

* Upgraded to Cesium 1.8.  See the [changelog](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/1.8/CHANGES.md) for details.

* Fixed a bug that prevented WFS datasets from working in Internet Explorer 10 and Safari.

### 2015-03-26

* Greatly enhanced support for ArcGIS servers.  ArcGIS map servers can now be queried for their list of layers to populate the Data Catalogue, and they can provide metadata information when clicking a feature on the map.
* Added features to the Tools panel (accessible by visiting http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/#tools=1) to test datasets.
* Added the "Broadband ADSL Availability" and "Broadband ADSL Availability no Borders" datasets to the catalogue under Communications.  Also fixed a typo in the name of "Broadband Availability no Borders".
