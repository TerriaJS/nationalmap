Change Log
==========

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.3.4.  Changes include:
  * Changed the "My Data" interface to be much more intuitive and tweaked the visual style of the catalog.
  * Removed the Terria logo from the preview map and made the credit there smaller.
  * Added the ability to add custom components to the feedback area (lower right) of the user interface.
  * Upgraded to Cesium v1.51.
  * Added "filterByProcedures" property to "sos" item (default: true). When false, the list of procedures is not passed as a filter to GetFeatureOfInterest request, which works better for BoM Water Data Online services.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the compass control to be misaligned in Internet Explorer 11.
  * Added `CartoMapCatalogItem` to connect to layers using the [Carto Maps API](https://carto.com/developers/maps-api/).
  * Made it possible to configure the compass control's colors using CSS.
  * Fall back to the style name in the workbench styles dropdown when no title is given for a style in WMS GetCapabilities.

### 2018-10-15

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.2.1.  Changes include:
  * Added a simple WCS "clip and ship" functionality for WMS layers with corresponding a WCS endpoint and coverage.
  * Fixed problems canceling drag-and-drop when using some web browsers.
  * Fixed a bug that created a time period where no data is shown at the end of a time-varying CSV.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause endless tile requests with certain types of incorrect server responses.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause endless region tile requests when loading a CSV with a time column where none of the column values could actually be interpreted as a time.
  * Added automatic retry with jittered, exponential backoff for tile requests that result in a 5xx HTTP status code. This is especially useful for servers that return 503 or 504 under load. Previously, TerriaJS would frequently disable the layer and hit the user with an error message when accessing such servers.
  * Updated British National Grid transform in `Proj4Definitions` to a more accurate (~2 m) 7 parameter version https://epsg.io/27700.
  * Distinguished between 3D Terrain and 3D Smooth in share links and init files.
  * We now use Cesium Ion for the Bing Maps basemaps, unless a `bingMapsKey` is provided in [config.json](https://docs.terria.io/guide/customizing/client-side-config/#parameters). You can control this behavior with the `useCesiumIonBingImagery` property. Please note that if a `bingMapsKey` is not provided, the Bing Maps geocoder will always return no results.
  * Added a Terria logo in the lower left of the map. It can be disabled by setting `"hideTerriaLogo": true` in `config.json`.
  * Improved the credits display on the 2D map to be more similar to the 3D credits.
  * Fixed a bug that caused some legends to be missing or incomplete in Apple Safari.
  * Upgraded to Cesium v1.50.

### 2018-09-21

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.1.4.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the workbench to appear narrower than expected on some systems, and the map to be off-center when collapsing the workbench on all systems.

### 2018-09-14

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.1.3.  Changes include:
  * When clicking a `Split` button on the workbench, the new catalog item will no longer be attached to the timeline even if the original was. This avoids a confusing situation where both catalog items would be locked to the same time.
  * Added KMZ to the whitelisted formats for `MagdaCatalogItem`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a crash when switching to 2D with vector data already on the map, including when visiting a share link with vector data when the map ends up being 2D.
  * The "Hide Workbench" button is now attached to the side of the Workbench, instead of on the opposite side of the screen from it.

### 2018-09-03

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.1.2.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented `BingMapsSearchProviderViewModel` and other uses of `loadJsonp` from working correctly.

### 2018-08-30

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.1.1.  Changes include:
  * Upgraded to terriajs-server v2.7.4.
  * The previous default terrain provider, STK World Terrain, has been deprecated by its provider. *To continue using terrain in your deployed applications, you _must_ obtain a Cesium Ion key and add it to `config.json`*. See https://cesium.com/ to create an Ion account. New options are available in `config.json` to configure terrain from Cesium Ion or from another source. See https://terria.io/Documentation/guide/customizing/client-side-config/#parameters for configuration details.
  * Upgraded to Cesium v1.48.
  * Added `Cesium3DTilesCatalogItem` for visualizing [Cesium 3D Tiles](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/3d-tiles) datasets.
  * Added `IonImageryCatalogItem` for accessing imagery assets on [Cesium Ion](https://cesium.com/).
  * Added support for Cesium Ion terrain assets to `CesiumTerrainProvider`. To use an asset from Ion, specify the `ionAssetId` and optionally the `ionAccessToken` and `ionServer` properties instead of specifying a `url`.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause legends to be missing from `WebMapServiceCatalogItems` that had `isEnabled` set to true.

### 2018-07-16

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.0.5.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that caused the order of items on the Workbench to change when visiting a share link.
  * Added `rel="noreferrer noopener"` to all `target="_blank"` links. This prevents the target page from being able to navigate the source tab to a new page.
  * Changed `CesiumSelectionIndicator` to no longer use Knockout binding. This will avoid a problem in some environments, such as when a Content Security Policy (CSP) is in place.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented users from being able to enter coordinates directly into catalog function point parameter fields.

### 2018-05-22

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.0.2.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented interaction with the 3D map when the splitter was active.

### 2018-05-17

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.0.1.  Changes include:
  * Added `parameters` property to `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem`, allowing arbitrary parameters to be passed in tile and feature info requests.

### 2018-05-16

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 6.0.0.  Changes include:
  * Breaking Changes:
    * An application-level polyfill suite is now required for Internet Explorer 9 and 10 compatibility. The easiest approach is to add `<script src="https://cdn.polyfill.io/v2/polyfill.min.js"></script>` to the `<head>` element of your application's HTML page.
    * In TerriaJS v7.0.0 (the _next_ major release), a polyfill suite may be required for Internet Explorer 11 as well. Adopting the approach above now will ensure you don't need to worry about it then.
  * Overhauled support for printing. There is now a Print button on the Share panel that will provide a much better printable form of the map than the browser's built-in print feature. If a user uses the browser's print button instead, a message at the top will suggest using the TerriaJS Print feature and open the Share panel. Calling `window.print` (e.g. on a TerriaJS instance inside an iframe) will invoke the new TerriaJS print feature directly.
  * Fixed a bug that caused `Leaflet.captureScreenshot` to show all layers on both sides even with the splitter active.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented some vector features from appearing in `Leaflet.captureScreenshot`.
  * Added ability to move the splitter thumb position vertically so that users can move it to prevent occlusions.
  * Added `TerriaJsonCatalogFunction`. This catalog function allows an arbitrary HTTP GET to be invoked with user-provided parameters and return TerriaJS catalog JSON.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the feature info panel to sometimes be nearly transparent in Internet Explorer 11.
  * Fixed a bug that caused an expanded preview chart's workbench item to erroneously show the date picker.
  * Updated `MagdaCatalogItem` to match Magda project

### 2018-04-16

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.7.0.  Changes include:
  * Added `MagdaCatalogItem` to load details of a catalog item from [Magda](https://github.com/TerriaJS/magda).
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a time-dynamic WMS layer to fail to ever show up on the map if the initial time on the timeline was outside the intervals where the layer had data.
  * Fixed a bug which could cause a crash during load from share link when the layer default is to not `useOwnClock` but the share link has `useOwnClock` set.
  * Fixed an issue that caused a 'This data source is already shown' error in particular circumstances.

### 2018-03-22

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.6.4.  Changes include:
  * Display of Lat Lon changed from 3 deciml places to 5 decimal places - just over 1m precision at equator.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the timeline to appear when changing the time on the workbench for a layer not attached to the timeline.
  * The workbench date/time picker is now available for time varying point and region CSVs.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the workbench date picker controls to disappear when the item was attached to the timeline and the timeline's current time was outside the valid range for the item.
  * Fixed a bug causing an error message when adding tabular data to the workbench before it was loaded.

### 2018-03-15

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.6.2.  Changes include:
  * Renamed search marker to location marker.
  * Added the clicked coordinates to the bottom of the feature info panel. Clicking the marker icon will cause the location to be indicated on the map.
  * The location marker is now included in shared map views.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause split WMS layers to show the incorrect layer data for the date shown in the workbench.
  * Refactored current time handling for `CatalogItem` to reduce the complexity and number of duplicated current time states.
  * Fixed feature info updating when the time is changed from the workbench for `TableCatalogItem`.
  * Change the workbench catalog item date picker so that updating the date does not disable the timeslider.
  * Fix a bug that meant that, when the current time was updated on an `ImageryCatalogItem` while the layer wasn't shown, the old time was still shown when the layer was re-enabled.
  * Added `{{terria.currentTime}}` to feature info template.
  * Added a way to format times within a feature info tempate. E.g. `{{#terria.formatDateTime}}{"format": "dd-mm-yyyy HH:MM:ss"}{{terria.currentTime}}{{/terria.formatDateTime}}`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the selection indicator to float strangely when visiting a share link with a selected feature.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a region to be selected even when clicking on a hole in that region.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the selection indicator from following moving features on the 2D map.
  * Fixed a bug that caused Leaflet to stop rendering further points in a layer and throw errors when calculating extent when one point had invalid characters in the latitude or longitude field.
  * We now default to `autoPlay: false` if it's not specified in `config.json`.
  * Changed search box placeholders to more precisely reflect their functionality.
  * CartoDB basemaps are now always loaded over HTTPS.

### 2018-02-15

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.6.1.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the workbench UI to hang when toggling concepts, particularly for an `SdmxJsonCatalogItem`.
  * Added previous and next buttons to workbench catalog item date picker.
  * Upgraded to Cesium 1.41.

### 2018-01-18

* Added `tern.org.au` to the proxy whitelist.
* Updated the contact email address to `data@digital.gov.au` in the static help pages.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.5.7.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that caused the feature info panel to stop working after clicking on a location search marker.
  * Added support for ArcGIS tokens on the 2D map. Previously, tokens only worked reliably in 3D.
  * Improved handling of tile errors, making it more consistent between 2D and 3D.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the Add Data button from working Internet Explorer 9 unless the DevTools were also open.
  * Improved the sizing of the feature info panel so it is less likely to completely obscure the map.
  * Added support for using tokens to access WMS layers, particularly using the WMS interface to ArcGIS servers.
  * Tweaked the sizing of the feature info panel.
  * Fixed a bug that caused `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` to always use the server's single fused map cache, if available. Now, if the `layers` property is specified, we request individual dynamic layers and ignore the fused map cache.

### 2017-11-30

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.5.4.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a serious bug that prevented opening the Data Catalog in Internet Explorer.
  * Fixed some problems with the Terria Spatial Analytics `CatalogFunctions`.

### 2017-11-21

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.5.3.  Changes include:
  * Added the ability to split the screen into a left-side and right-side, and show raster and region mapped layers on only one side of the splitter.
  * Added the ability to use a tabbed catalog in the explorer panel on desktop site. Setting `tabbedCatalog` parameter to `true` in `config.json` causes top-level groups in the catalog to list items in separate explorer panel tabs.
  * Added the ability to use vector tile properties in feature info templates when using region mapping (data row attributes will overwrite vector tile properties with the same name).
  * Properties available in feature info templates are now JSON parsed and replaced by their javascript object if they start with `[` or `{` and parse successfully.
  * Decreased flickering of time-varying region mapped layers by pre-rendering the next time interval.
  * Fixed a bug in `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` that could cause a WMS time time dimension to be interpreted incorrectly if it was specified only using dates (not times) and with a periodicity of less than a day.
  * Added `cannotSum` property to SDMX-JSON catalog items. This is used to identify the measures that cannot be summed so that TerriaJS won't display a Total when more than one of these are selected and it will not show a "Display as a percentage of regional total" checkbox in the workbench UI. `cannotSum` can be either a mapping of concept ids to the values that prevent summing, or simply `true` to always prevent summing.

### 2017-11-13

* Added `AEC_FED_2017_AMLS` region type.
* Added `data61.io` and `d61.io` to the proxy whitelist.

### 2017-11-09

* Removed six datasets from the catalog that have been taken down from the ABS SDMX-JSON service (ABS_ERP_LGA, ABS_ANNUAL_ERP_LGA, ABS_ANNUAL_ERP_LGA2014, ABS_ERP_LGA2014, ABS_ANNUAL_ERP_LGA2015, ABS_ERP_LGA2015)
* Added two replacement datasets to the catalog, ABS_ERP_LGA2016 and ABS_ANNUAL_ERP_LGA2016.
* Added ATSI_BIRTHS_SUMM, ATSI_FERTILITY, ABS_BLDG_APPROVALS_LGA2016, ABS_BA_SA2_ASGS2016, CONFINEMENTS_NUPTIALITY, CONFINEMENTS_PLURALITY, FERTILITY_AGE_STATE, PATERNITY_AGE_STATE, RES_DWELL, RES_PROP_INDEX.
* Fixed broken link in Broadband layer descriptions and add some text explaining that the data is historical.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.4.5.  Changes include:
  * Added support for specifying namespaced layer names in the `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` `layers` property.
  * Made TerriaJS tolerant of XML/HTML inside text elements in WMS GetCapabilities without being properly wrapped in `CDATA`.
  * Improved behaviour of SDMX-JSON items when no data is available.

### 2017-10-31

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.4.3.  Changes include:
  * We no longer show the Zoom To button on the workbench when there is no rectangle to zoom to.
  * Fixed a bug when sharing SDMX-JSON catalog items.
  * Improved display of "Add Data" panel on small screens when Feedback and Feature Info panels are open.
  * Added "search in data catalog" link to mobile search.
  * Added a button to automatically copy share url into clipboard in share panel.
  * Added `initFragmentPaths` property to the `parameters` section of `config.json`.  It can be used to specify an array of base paths for resolving init fragments in the URL.
  * Modified `CkanCatalogItem` to exclude files that advertise themselves as KML files but have the file extension .ZIP.
  * Removed "View full size image" link on the share panel.  Chrome 60 removed the ability to navigate to a data URI, and other browsers are expected to follow this lead.

### 2017-10-16

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.4.0.  Changes include:
  * Breaking change: removed some old types that haven't been used since the new React-based user interface in v4.0.0, specifically `KnockoutHammerBinding`, `KnockoutMarkdownBinding`, `PopupMessageConfirmationViewModel`, `PopupMessageViewModel`, and `PopupViewModel`.
  * Added the ability to use tokens from terriajs-server for layers requiring ESRI tokens.
  * Catalog group items are now sorted by their in-catalog name

### 2017-09-15

* Added more datasets from the 2016 Census.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.3.0.  Changes include:
  * Added the ability to use the analytics region picker with vector tile region mapping by specifiying a WMS server & layer for analytics only.
  * Updated the client side validation to use the server-provided file size limit when drag/dropping a file requiring the conversion service.
  * `zoomOnEnable` now works even for a catalog item that is initially enabled in the catalog.  Previously, it only worked for catalog items enabled via the user interface or otherwise outside of the load process.
  * Added `initialTimeSource` property to `CsvCatalogItem` so it is possible to specify the value of the animation timeline at start from init files.
  * Added to documentation for customizing data appearance.
  * Added `CatalogShortcut` for creating tool items for linking to a `CatalogItem`.
  * Renamed `ViewState.viewCatalogItem()` to `viewCatalogMember` to reflect that it can be used for all `CatalogMembers`, not just `CatalogItems`.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when switching to 2D when the `initialView` was just a `Rectangle` instead of a `CameraView`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused multiple layers with generated, gradient legends to all show the same legend on the Workbench.

### 2017-08-15

* Added adelaidemetro.com.au to the proxy whitelist.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.2.11.  Changes include:
  * The Share feature now includes the current time selected on the timeline, so that anyone visiting a share link will see the map at the intended time.
  * Improved the conversion of Esri polygons to GeoJSON by `featureDataToGeoJson`.  It now correctly handles polygons with holes and with multiple outer rings.
  * Added some fields to the dataset info page for `CkanCatalogItem`.
  * A catalog item's `cacheDuration` property now takes precedence over the cache duration specified by the code.  Previously, the `cacheDuration` would only override the default duration (2 weeks).
  * Added option to expand the HTML embed code and toggle URL shorting for the share link.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause some layers, especially the Bing Maps basemap, to occasionally be missing from the 2D map.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the selected time to move to the end time when sharing a map with a time-dynamic layer.
  * Pinned `urijs` to v1.18.10 to work around a breaking change in v1.18.11.

### 2017-07-21

* Added new ASGS 2016 region definitions for use with region-mapped CSVs, ABS data, etc.
* Added Australian Bureau of Statistics Census 2016 layers to the catalog.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.2.7.  Changes include:
  * Added the Latitude and Longitude to the filename for the Feature Information file download.
  * Added the time to the timeline labels when zoomed in to a single day. Previously, the label sometimes only showed the date.
  * Added the ability to disable the conversion service so that no user data is sent outside of the client by setting `conversionServiceBaseUrl` to `false` in the `parameters` section of `config.json`.
  * Added the ability to disable the location button by setting `disableMyLocation` to `true` in the `parameters` section of `config.json`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the share functionality to fail (both screenshot and share link) in 2d mode.
  * Fixed a bug with explicitly styled enum columns in Internet Explorer.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the selected column in a csv to be the second column when a time column is present.

### 2017-06-15

* Add SA1-4, GCCSA & STE from ASGS 2016 and update short region mapping aliases to point to these.
* Add Stats New Zealand Area Units and Mesh Blocks to region mapping. These are available under the aliases nz_au_code_2017, nz_au_name_2017 & nz_mb_2017_code.
* Changed the 2011 ABS SDMX-JSON items to explicitly require 2011 regions, because the default will be updated to 2016.
* Used the correct ID for the City of Launceston on data.gov.au: `city-of-launceston` instead of `cityoflaunceston`.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.2.5.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug with `forceProxy: true` which meant that vector tiles would try, and fail, to load over the proxy.
  * Added documentation for customizing data appearance, and folded in existing but orphaned documentation for creating feature info templates.
  * Changed the LocateMe button so that it toggles and continuously updates the location when Augmented Reality is enabled.
  * Added the ability to set SDMX-JSON region names from a region type dimension, using a Mustache template. This was required so regions can be mapped to specific years, even if not specified by the SDMX-JSON server.
  * Added `viewermode` to the users persistent local storage to remember the last `ViewerMode` used.
  * Added the ability to customize the preamble text on the feedback form ("We would love to hear from you!") by setting `feedbackPreamble` in the `parameters` section of `config.json`.

### 2017-05-15

* Added a link to the State of Environment Map under Related Maps.
* Added `lakemac.com.au` to proxy whitelist. ([#477](https://github.com/TerriaJS/nationalmap/issues/477))
* Added `data.aodn.org.au` to the proxy whitelist. ([#479](https://github.com/TerriaJS/nationalmap/issues/479))
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.2.4.  Changes include:
  * Fixed a bug that caused an 'added' and a 'shown' event for "Unnamed Item" to be logged to Google Analytics when previewing an item in the catalog.
  * Added a 'preview' Google Analytics event when a catalog item is shown on the preview map in the catalog.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented csv files with missing dates from loading.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause an error when adding a layer without previewing it first.
  * Fixed a bug that caused layer disclaimers to fail to appear when the layer was enabled via a share link.  Since the user was unable to accept the disclaimer, the layer also failed to appear.
  * Added `AugmentedVirtuality` (user facing feature name Augmented Reality) to allow users to use their mobile device's orientation to set the camera view.
  * Added the `showFeaturesAtAllTimes` option to Sensor Observation Service items. This improves the user experience if the server returns
    some features starting in 1990, say, and some starting in 1995, so that the latter still appear (as grey points with no data) in 1990.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented preview charts in the feature info panel from updating when the user changed the Sensor Observation Service frequency.
  * Fixed a bug that allowed the user to de-select all the display choices for Sensor Observation Service items.
  * Improved the appearance of charts where all the y-values are null. (It now shows "No preview available".)
  * Upgraded to Leaflet 1.0.3 for the 2D and preview maps.
  * Upgraded to [Cesium 1.33](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/1.33/CHANGES.md) for the 3D view.
  * Changed the default opacity for points from CSV files without a value column to 1.0 (previously it was 0.6).  This is a workaround for a Cesium bug (https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/5307) but really a better choice anyway.
  * Fixed a bug which meant non-standard properties of some table data sources (eg. csv, SOS, SDMX-JSON) were missing in the feature info panel, because of a breaking change in Cesium 1.33.
  * Fixed download of selected dataset (as csv) so that quotes are handled in accordance with https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180. As a result, more such downloads can be directly re-loaded in Terria by dragging and dropping them.
  * Fixed a bug that gave expanded Sensor Observation Service charts poor names.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented some table-based datasets from loading.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented error messages, such as when a dataset fails to load, from being shown to the user. Instead, the errors were silently ignored.

### 2017-04-13

* Turned off the automatic animation of time-series data when an item is enabled. The user must now explicitly press the play button to see this.
* The filter that extracts Local Governments from the general data.gov.au organisations now uses a precise field instead of guessing based on the name.
* Fixed incorrect region IDs for ABS CED 2016 layers.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 5.1.0.  Changes include:
  * Breaking changes:
    * Starting with this release, TerriaJS is meant to be built with Webpack 2.  The best way to upgrade your application is to merge from [TerriaMap](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap).  If you run into trouble, post a message on the [TerriaJS forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/terriajs).
    * Removed the following previously-deprecated modules: `registerKnockoutBindings` (no replacement), `AsyncFunctionResultCatalogItem` (now `ResultPendingCatalogItem`), `PlacesLikeMeFunction` (now `PlacesLikeMeCatalogFunction`), `SpatialDetailingFunction` (now `SpatialDetailingCatalogFunction`), and `WhyAmISpecialFunction` (now `WhyAmISpecialCatalogFunction`).
    * Removed `lib/Sass/StandardUserInterface.scss`.  It is no longer necessary to include this in your application.
    * Removed the previously-deprecated third pararameter, `getColorCallback`, of `DisplayVariablesConcept`.  Pass it inside the `options` parameter instead.
    * Removed the following previously-deprecated properties from `TableColumn`: `indicesIntoUniqueValues` (use `uniqueValues`), `indicesOrValues` (use `values`), `indicesOrNumericalValues` (use `uniqueValues` or `numericalValues`), and `usesIndicesIntoUniqueValues` (use `isEnum`).
    * Removed the previously-deprecated `dataSetID` property from `AbsIttCatalogItem`.  Use `datasetId` instead.
    * Removed the previously-deprecated `allowGroups` property from `CkanCatalogItem`.   Use `allowWmsGroups` or `allowWfsGroups` instead.
    * Removed the previously-deprecated `RegionMapping.setRegionColumnType` function.  Use the `setRegionColumnType` on an _instance_ of `RegionMapping` instead.
    * Removed the previously-deprecated `regionMapping.regionDetails[].column` and `.disambigColumn`. Use `.columnName` and `.disambigColumnName` instead.
    * Removed the previously-deprecated `options.regionMappingDefinitionsUrl` parameter from the `Terria` constructor.  Set the `regionMappingDefinitionsUrl` inside `parameters` in `config.json` instead.
  * Fixed a bug in `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` that prevented TerriaJS from correctly determining the projections supported by a WMS layer when supported projections are inherited from parent layers.
  * Changed "no value" colour of region-mapped data to fully transparent, not black.
  * Fixed an issue where expanding a chart from an SDMX-JSON or SOS feature twice, with different data choices selected, would overwrite the previous chart.
  * Improved SDMX-JSON items to still show properly, even if the `selectedInitially` property is invalid.
  * Added `Score` column to `GNAFAddressGeocoder` to indicate relative quality, which maps as default variable.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` from acting as a time-dynamic layer when the time dimension was inherited from a parent layer.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now supports WMS 1.1.1 style dimensions (with an `Extent` element) in addition to the 1.3.0 style (`Dimension` only).
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now passes dates only (rather than dates and times) to the server when the TIME dimension uses the `start/stop/period` form, `start` is a date only, and `period` does not include hours, minutes, or seconds.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now supports years and months (in addition to days, hours, minutes, and seconds) in the period specified of a TIME dimension.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now ignores [leap seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second) when evaluating ISO8601 periods in a time dimension.  As a result, 2 hours after `2016-06-30T23:00:00Z` is now `2016-07-01T01:00:00Z` instead of `2016-07-01T00:59:59Z` even though a leap second at the end of June 2016 makes that technically 2 hours and 1 second.  We expect that this is more likely to align with the expectations of WMS server software.
  * Added option to specify `mobileDefaultViewerMode` in the `parameters` section of `config.json` to specify the default view mode when running on a mobile platform.
  * Added support for `itemProperties` to `CswCatalogGroup`.
  * Added `terria.urlEncode` function for use in feature info templates.
  * Fixed a layout problem that caused the coordinates on the location bar to be displayed below the bar itself in Internet Explorer 11.
  * Updated syntax to remove deprecation warnings with React version 15.5.

### 2017-03-15

* Deprecated the old Australian Bureau of Statistics group and instead interspersed ABS items (now based on SDMX-JSON) into National Datasets.  Moved a few existing items into subfolders as appropriate.
* Moved `Agricultural exposure` from `Social and Economic` to `Land`.
* Moved ABS Statistical Boundaries datasets into the Data Providers group.
* Specified the character set for the ABC Photo Stories CSV file in order to fix a problem with incorrect display of unusual characters.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.10.5.  Changes include:
  * Improved error message when accessing the user's location under http with Chrome.
  * When searching locations, the button to instead search the catalog is now above the results instead of below them.
  * Changed "go to full screen mode" tooltip to "Hide workbench", and "Exit Full Screen" button to "Show Workbench".  The term "full screen" was misleading.
  * Fixed a bug where a chartable (non-geo-spatial) CSV file with a column including the text "height" would not let the user choose the "height" column as the y-axis of a chart.
  * Added support for non-default x-axes for charts via `<chart x-column="x">` and the new `tableStyle.xAxis` parameter.
  * Added support for a `charSet` parameter on CSV catalog items, which overrides the server's mime-type if present.
  * Added the ability for `CkanCatalogGroup` to receive results in pages, rather than all in one request.  This will happen automatically when the server returns partial results.
  * Improved the performance of the catalog UI by not creating React elements for the contents of a group until that group is opened.
  * Close polygons used as input to a `CatalogFunction` by making the last position the same as the first one.
  * Added support for a new `nameInCatalog` property on all catalog members which overrides `name` when displayed in the catalog, if present.
  * Added `terria.urlEncodeComponent` function for use in feature info templates.
  * `yAxisMin` and `yAxisMax` are now honored when multiple charts are active, by using the minimum `yAxisMin` and the maximum `yAxisMax` of all charts.
  * Locked third-party dependency proj4 to v2.3.x because v2.4.0 breaks our build.
  * New sections are now merged info `CatalogMember.info` when `updateFromJson` is called multiple times, rather than the later `info` completely replacing the earlier one.  This is most useful when using `itemProperties` to override some of the info sections in a child catalog item.
  * Fixed a bug where csv files with a date column would sometimes fail if a date is missing.

### 2017-02-15

* Fixed the link to the "NEII viewer" related map when the image is clicked.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.10.1.  Changes include:
  * Changed defaults:
    * `WebProcessingServiceCatalogFunction` now defaults to invoking the `Execute` service via an HTTP POST with XML encoding rather than an HTTP GET with KVP encoding.  This is a more sensible default because the WPS specification requires that servers support POST/XML while GET/KVP is optional.  Plus, POST/XML allows large input parameters, such as a polygon descibing all of Australia, to be successfully passed to the WPS process.  To force use of GET/KVP, set the `executeWithHttpGet` property to `true`.
  * Improved the SDMX-JSON catalog item to handle huge dimensions, allow a blacklist, handle bad responses better, and more.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the proxy from being used for loading legends, even in situations where it is necessary such as an `http` legend accessed from an `https` site.
  * Added link to re-download local files, noting that TerriaJS may have done additional processing (eg. geocoding).
  * Fixed problems with third-party dependencies causing `npm install` and `npm run gulp` to fail.
  * Added a help overlay system. A TerriaJS application can define a set of help sequences that interactively walk the user through a task, such as adding data to the map or changing map settings. The help sequences usually appear as a drop-down Help menu in the top-right corner.
  * Fixed a bug with calculating bounding rectangles in `ArcGisCatalogItem` caused by changes to `proj4` package.
  * Fixed a bug preventing chart axis labels from being visible on a white background.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the Feedback panel to appear below the chart panel, making it difficult to use.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented a `shareUrl` specified in `config.json` from actually being used by the `ShareDataService`.
  * Adding a JSON init file by dropping it on the map or selecting it from the My Data tab no longer adds an entry to the Workbench and User-Added Data catalog.
  * WPS return type can now be `application/vnd.terriajs.catalog-member+json` which allows a json catalog member to be returned in WPS along with the usual attributes to control display.
  * `chartLineColor` tableStyle attribute added, allowing per column specification of chart line color.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` inside a `WebMapServiceCatalogGroup` to revert to defaults from GetCapabilities instead of using shared properties.
  * Fix a bug that prevented drawing the marker and zooming to the point when searching for a location in 2D.
  * Fixed a bug where `WebMapTileServiceCatalogItem` would incorrectly interpret a bounding box and return only the lower left corner causing Cesium to crash on render.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the feedback form to be submitted when unchecking "Share my map view".

### 2017-01-12

* Added a bulk geocoder based on the Geocoded National Address File (G-NAF). When a CSV file that contains addresses is added, instead of showing data per region, the addresses will be geocoded and the resulting lat-long points will be shown.
* Added `localdata.net.au` to the proxy whitelist.
* This release includes no new catalog changes.  However, the following already-live catalog changes were made since the last release:
  * Renamed `National Data Sets` to `National Datasets`.
  * Renamed `ABS statistical boundaries` to `ABS Statistical Boundaries`.
  * Added New Victorian LGAs.
  * Added 2012-13 and 2013-14 Taxation Statistics.
  * Updated ABS 2016 Boundaries.
  * Updated Taxation Statistics ColorPalettes and ColorBins.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.8.1.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Updated G-NAF API to new Lucene-based backend, which should improve performance.
  * Updated custom `<chart>` tag to allow a `colors` attribute, containing comma separated css strings (one per column), allowing users to customize chart colors. The `colors` attribute in charts can also be passed through from a WPS ComplexData response.
  * Updated styling of Give Feedback form.
  * Improved consistency of "Search" and "Add Data" font sizes.
  * Improved flexibility of Feature Info Panel styling.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause an extra `/` to be added to end of URLs by `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem`, causing some servers to reject the request.
  * Added a workaround for a bug in Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 that could cause the user interface to hang.
  * Canceled pending tile requests when removing a layer from the 2D map.  This should drastically improve the responsiveness when dragging the time slider of a time-dynamic layer in 2D mode.
  * Added the data source and data service details to the "About this dataset" (preview) panel.
  * Renamed `SpatialDetailingFunction`, `WhyAmISpecialFunction`, and `PlacesLikeMeFunction` to `SpatialDetailingCatalogFunction`, `WhyAmISpecialCatalogFunction`, and `PlacesLikeMeCatalogFunction`, respectively.  The old names will be removed in a future release.
  * Fixed incorrect tooltip text for the Share button.
  * Improved the build process and content of the user guide documentation.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented downloading data from the chart panel if the map was started in 2D mode.
  * Changed the default opacity of table data to 0.8 from 0.6.
  * Added the ability to read dates in the format "2017-Q2".
  * Improved support for SDMX-JSON, including showing values as a percent of regional totals, showing the selected conditions in a more concise format, and fixing some bugs.
  * Updated `TableCatalogItem`s to show a download URL in About This Dataset, which downloads the entire dataset as csv, even if the original data was more complex (eg. from an API).
  * The icon specified to the `MenuPanel` / `DropdownPanel` theme can now be either the identifier of an icon from `Icon.GLYPHS` or an actual SVG `require`'d via the `svg-sprite-loader`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused time-varying points from a CSV file to leave a trail on the 2D map.
  * Add `Terria.filterStartDataCallback`.  This callback gives an application the opportunity to modify start (share) data supplied in a URL before TerriaJS loads it.
    * Reduced the size of the initial TerriaJS JavaScript code by about 30% when starting in 2D mode.
  * `CkanCatalogGroup` now automatically adds the type of the resource (e.g. `(WMS)`) after the name when a dataset contains multiple resources that can be turned into catalog items and `useResourceName` is false.
  * Added support for ArcGIS FeatureServers to `CkanCatalogGroup` and `CkanCatalogItem`.  In order for `CkanCatalogGroup` to include FeatureServers, `includeEsriFeatureServer` must be set to true.
  * Changed default URL for the share service from `/share` to `share` and made it configurable by specifying `shareUrl` in config.json.  This helps with deployments in subdirectories.
  * Upgraded to [Cesium 1.29](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/1.29/CHANGES.md).

### 2016-12-05

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.7.1.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug leading to oversized graphics being displayed from WPS calls.
  * Fixed a bug where providing feedback did not properly share the map view.

### 2016-12-03

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.7.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Support added for creating custom WPS types, and for reusing `Point`, `Polygon`, and `Region` editors in custom types.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the legend to be missing for WMS catalog items where the legend came from GetCapabilities but the URL did not contain `GetLegendGraphic`.
  * Add the ability for users to share their view of the map when providing feedback.
  * Extra components can now be added to FeatureInfoSection.
  * "Download Data" in FeatureInfoSection now "Download Data for this Feature".
  * Fixed the color of visited links in client apps with their own css variables.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the scale bar from displaying correctly.

### 2016-11-15

* Fixed link to NEII viewer in related maps.
* Added a button below the map navigation buttons to measure the distance between points.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.6.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Change in defaults:
    * The `clipToRectangle` property of raster catalog items (`WebMapServiceCatalogItem`, `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem`, etc.) now defaults to `true`.  It was `false` in previous releases.  Using `false` prevents features (especially point features) right at the edge of the layer's rectangle from being cut off when the server reports too tight a rectangle, but also causes the layer to load much more slowly in many cases.  Starting in this version, we favour performance and the much more common case that the rectangle can be trusted.
  * Made `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` tolerant of a `GetCapabilities` where a `LegendURL` element does not have an `OnlineResource` or a `Dimension` does not have any values.
  * Add support for 'Long' type hint to CSV data for specifying longitude.
  * The marker indicating the location of a search result is now placed correctly on the terrain surface.
  * `CatalogFunction` region parameters are now selected on the main map rather than the preview map.
  * Some regions that were previously not selectable in Analytics, except via autocomplete, are now selectable.
  * Added hover text that shows the position of data catalog search results in the full catalog.
  * Widened scrollbars and improve their contrast.
  * Removed the default maximum number of 10 results when searching the data catalog.
  * Allow users to browse for JSON configuration files when adding "Local Data".
  * Made it easier to use custom fonts and colors in applications built on TerriaJS, via new SCSS variables.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a `CswCatalogGroup` to fail to load if the server had a `references` element without a `protocol`.
  * The order of the legend for an `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` now matches the order used by ArcGIS itself.
  * Large legends are now scaled down to fit within the width of the workbench panel.
  * Improved the styling of links inside the Feature Information panel.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the Feature Information panel's close button to initially appear in the wrong place, and then jump to the right place when moving the mouse near it.

### 2016-10-14

* Support `openAddData` option in config.json. If true, the "Add Data" dialog is automatically opened at start up.
* Switched to using vector tiles for region mapping.  This means region mapping is now faster and has much improved visual quality, but it no longer works with very old browsers like Internet Explorer 9.
* Updated list of LGAs from data.gov.au.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.5.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Added support for the Sensor Observation Service format, via the `SensorObservationServiceCatalogItem`.
  * Added support for end date columns in CSV data (automatic with column names containing `end_date`, `end date`, `end_time`, `end time`; or set in json file using `isEndDate` in `tableStyle.columns`.
  * Fixed calculation of end dates for moving-point CSV files, which could lead to points disappearing periodically.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented fractional seconds in time-varying WMS periodicity.
  * Added the ability to the workbench UI to select the `style` to use to display a Web Map Service (WMS) layer when multiple styles are available.
  * Added the ability to the workbench UI to select from among the available dimensions of a Web Map Service (WMS) layer.
  * Improved the error reporting and handling when specifying invalid values for the WMS COLORSCALERANGE parameter in the UI.
  * Added the ability to drag existing points when creating a `UserDrawing`.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause nonsensical legends for CSV columns with all null values.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the Share panel from being used at all if the URL shortening service encountered an error.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause an error when adding multiple catalog items to the map quickly.
  * Tweaked the z-order of the window that appears when hovering over a chart series, so that it does not appear on top of the Feature Information panel.
  * Fixed a bug that could lead to incorrect colors in a legend for a CSV file with explicit `colorBins` and cut off at a minimum and maximum.
  * We now show the feature info panel the first time a dataset is added, containing a suggestion to click the map to learn more about a location.  Also improved the wording for the feature info panel when there is no data.
  * Fixed support for time-varying feature info for vector tile based region mapping.
  * `updateApplicationOnMessageFromParentWindow` now also allows messages from the `opener` window, i.e. the window that opened the page by calling `window.open`.  The parent or opener may now also send a message with an `allowOrigin` property to specify an origin that should be allowed to post messages.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented charts from loading http urls from https.
  * The `isNcWMS` property of `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` is now set to true, and the COLORSCALERANGE controls are available in the UI, for ncWMS2 servers.
  * Added the ability to prevent CSVs with time and `id` columns from appearing as moving points, by setting `idColumns` to either `null` or `[]`.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented default parameters to `CatalogFunction`s from being shown in the user interface.
  * Fixed a problem that made `BooleanParameter`s show up incorrectly in the user interface.
  * Embedded `<chart>` elements now support two new optional attributes:
     * `title`: overrides the title that would otherwise be derived from the name of the feature.
     * `hide-buttons`: If `"true"`, the Expand and Download buttons are hidden from the chart.
  * Fixed a bug in embedded `<collapsible>` elements that prevented them from being expandable.
  * Improved SDMX-JSON support to make it possible to change region type in the UI.
  * Deprecated `RegionMapping.setRegionColumnType` in favour of `RegionMapping.prototype.setRegionColumnType`. `regionDetails[].column` and `.disambigColumn` have also been deprecated.

### 2016-09-15

* Clean up support for commonwealth electoral boundaries with ABS and AEC sources. `com_elb_id_2016` and `com_elb_name_2016` are the standard field names now.
* Fixed four broken datasets in Land and one in Infrastructure, as a result of URL changes.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.4.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that caused Cesium (3D view) to crash when plotting a CSV with non-numerical data in the depth column.
  * Added automatic time-series charts of attributes to the feature info of time-varying region-mapped csvs.
  * Refactored Csv, AbsItt and Sdmx-Json catalog items to depend on a common `TableCatalogItem`. Deprecated `CsvCatalogItem.setActiveTimeColumn` in favour of `tableStructure.setActiveTimeColumn`.
  * Error in geocoding addresses in csv files now shows in dialog box.
  * Fixed CSS styling of the timeline and added padding to the feature info panel.
  * Enhanced JSON support to recognise JSON5 format for user-added files.
  * Deprecated `indicesIntoUniqueValues`, `indicesOrValues`, `indicesOrNumericalValues` and `usesIndicesIntoUniqueValues` in `TableColumn` (`isEnum` replaces `usesIndicesIntoUniqueValues`).
  * Added support for explicitly colouring enum columns using a `tableStyle.colorBins` array of `{"value":v, "color":c}` objects
  * Improved rendering speed when changing the display variable for large lat/lon csv files.
  * Default to moving feature CSVs if a time, latitude, longitude and a column named `id` are present.
  * Fixed a bug so units flow through to charts of moving CSV features.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the `contextItem` of a `CatalogFunction` from showing during location selection.
  * Fixed a bug that caused `&amp;` to appear in some URLs instead of simply `&`, leading to an error when visiting the link.
  * Added the ability to pass a LineString to a Web Processing Service.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented `tableStyle.dataVariable` = `null` from working.
  * Uses a smarter default column for CSV files.
  * Fixed a bug that caused an error message to appear repeatedly when there was an error downloading tiles for a base map.
  * Fixed a bug that caused WMS layer names and WFS type names to not be displayed on the dataset info page.
  * We now preserve the state of the feature information panel when sharing.  This was lost in the transition to the new user interface in 4.0.0.
  * Added a popup message when using region mapping on old browsers without an `ArrayBuffer` type (such as Internet Explorer 9).  These browsers won't support vector tile based region mapping.
  * Fixed bug where generic parameters such as strings were not passed through to WPS services.
  * Fixed a bug where the chart panel did not update with polled data files.
  * Removed the Australian Hydrography layer from `createAustraliaBaseMapOptions`, as the source is no longer available.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the GetCapabilities URL of a WMS catalog item to be shown even when `hideSource` was set to true.
  * Newly-added user data is now automatically selected for the preview map.
  * Fixed a bug where selecting a new column on a moving point CSV file did not update the chart in the feature info panel.
  * Fixed dropdowns dropping from the bounds of the screen in Safari.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the feature info panel from updating with polled lat/lon csvs.
  * Improved handing of missing data in charts, so that it is ignored instead of shown as 0.

### 2016-08-25

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.3.2.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Added a loading indicator for user-added files.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented printing the map in the 2D mode.
  * Fixed a bug when changing between x-axis units in the chart panel.
* Added `"ungroupedTitle": null` to `tind.json` to fix the Telecommunications in New Developments embedded map.

### 2016-08-15b

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.2.1.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Added support for ArcGis FeatureServers, using the new catalog types `esri-featureServer` and `esri-featureServer-group`. Catalog type `esri-group` can load REST service, MapServer and FeatureServer endpoints. (For backwards compatability, catalog type `esri-mapServer-group` continues to work for REST service as well as MapServer endpoints.)
  * Adds bulk geocoding capability for Australian addresses. So GnafAPI can be used with batches of addresses, if configured.
  * Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.23 (from 1.20).  See the [change log](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/1.23/CHANGES.md) for details.
  * Added support for a wider range of SDMX-JSON data files, including the ability to sum over dimensions via `aggregatedDimensionIds`.
  * Added support for `tableStyle.colorBins` as array of values specifying the boundaries between the color bins in the legend, eg. `[3000, 3500, 3900, 4000]`. `colorBins` can still be an integer specifying the number of bins, in which case Terria determines the boundaries.
  * Added support for moving-point csv files, via an `idColumns` array on csv catalog items. By default, feature positions, color and size are interpolated between the known time values; set `isSampled` to false to prevent this. (Color and size are never interpolated when they are drawn from a text column.)
  * Added support for polling csv files with a partial update, and by using `idColumns` to identify features across updates.
  * Added a time series chart to the Feature Info Panel for sampled, moving features.
  * Fixed a bug which prevented time-varying CZML feature info from updating.
  * Made explorer panel not rendered at all when hidden and made the preview map destroy itself when unmounted - this mitigates performance issues from having Leaflet running in the background on very busy vector datasets.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the selection indicator to get small when near the right edge of the map and to overlap the side panel when past the left edge.
  * Map controls and menus now become translucent while the explorer window (Data Catalog) is visible.
  * Legend images that fail to load are now hidden entirely.
  * Improved the appearance of the opacity slider and added a percentage display.

### 2016-07-20a

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.1.2.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented sharing from working in Internet Explorer.

### 2016-07-20

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.1.1.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Worked around a problem in the Websense Web Filter that caused it to block access to some of the TerriaJS Web Workers due to a URL in the license text in a comment in a source file.
  * Made the column title for time-based CSV exports from chart default to 'date'
  * Stopped the CSV creation webworker from being run multiple times on viewing a chart.
  * Removed the empty circles from non-selected base maps on the Map settings panel.
  * Prevented text from being selected when dragging the compass control.
  * Stopped IE9 from setting bizarre inline dimensions on custom branding images.
  * Fixed workbench reordering in browsers other than Chrome.
  * URLs on the dataset info page are now auto-selected when clicked, making them easier to copy.

### 2016-07-15

* Catalog (init) files can now be stored as .ejs files in /datasources, rendered by the EJS templating library. See comments in gulpfile.js.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 4.0.2.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * A brand new user interface, incorporating user feedback and the results of usability testing!
  * `CswCatalogGroup` will now include Web Processing Services from the catalog if configured with `includeWps` set to true.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` will now detect ncWMS servers and set isNcWMS to true.
  * Uses a new mechanism for storing the data associated with the Share feature, avoid URL length limits.
  * Added partial support for the SDMX-JSON format.

### 2016-06-15

* Added a prominent link to the preview of the new UI.
* Added GNAF as a location search provider.
* Fixed an issue where the 404 error page would display incorrectly if given a non-existent path (eg, nationlmap.gov.au/nonexistent/path)
* Added CNT3 as an alias for ISO3 as a csv column name (for three-letter country codes).
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 3.3.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * `CkanCatalogItem.createCatalogItemFromResource`'s `options.allowGroups` has been replaced with `options.allowWmsGroups` and `options.allowWfsGroups`.
  * Added support for WFS in CKAN items.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the terriajs-server's `"proxyAllDomains": true` option from working.
  * Added support in FeatureInfoTemplate for referencing CSV columns by either their name in the CSV file, or the name they are given via `TableStyle.columns...name` (if any).
  * Improved CSV handling to ignore any blank lines, ie. those containing only commas.
  * Fixed a bug in `CswCatalogGroup` that prevented it from working in Internet Explorer.
  * Fixed a bug on IE9 that prevented shortened URLs from loading.
  * Fixed a map started with smooth terrain being unable to switch to 3D terrain.
  * Fixed a bug in `CkanCatalogItem` that prevented it from using the proxy for dataset URLs.
  * Fixed feature picking when displaying a point-based vector and a region mapped layer at the same time.
  * Stopped generation of WMS intervals being dependent on JS dates and hence sensitive to daylight savings time gaps.
  * Fixed a bug that led to zero property values being considered time-varying in the Feature Info panel.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented lat/lon injection into templates with time-varying properties.
  * Add `parameters` property in `WebFeatureServiceCatalogItem` to allow accessing URLs that need additional parameters.
  * Fixed a bug where visiting a shared link with a time-series layer would crash on load.
  * Added a direct way to format numbers in feature info templates, eg. `{{#terria.formatNumber}}{"useGrouping": true, "maximumFractionDigits": 3}{{value}}{{/terria.formatNumber}}`. The quotes around the keys are optional.
  * When the number of unique values in a CSV column exceeds the number of color bins available, the legend now displays "XX other values" as the label for the last bucket rather than simply "Other".
  * CSV columns with up to 21 unique values can now be fully displayed in the legend.  Previously, the number of bins was limited to 9.
  * Added `cycle` option to `tableColumnStyle.colorBinMethod` for enumeration-type CSV columns.  When the number of unique values in the column exceeds the number of color bins available, this option makes TerriaJS color all values by cycling through the available colors, rather than coloring only the most common values and lumping the rest into an "Other" bucket.
  * Metadata and single data files (e.g. KML, GeoJSON) are now consistently cached for one day instead of two weeks.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now uses the legend for the `style` specified in `parameters` when possible.  It also now includes the `parameters` when building a `GetLegendGraphic` URL.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented switching to the 3D view after starting the application in 2D mode.
### 2016-06-15
* Support "globalDisclaimer" configuration option, defined as follows:
        "globalDisclaimer": {
            "confirmationRequired": true, // Whether user must click the correct button to dismiss it (otherwise click anywhere)
            "buttonTitle": "I agree",     // Text for that button (defaults to "Ok").
            "title": "Disclaimer",        // Title for the window
            "prodHostRegex": "gov.\\.au$", // If this regular expression is NOT matched, add the DevelopmentDisclaimerPreamble.html
            "devHostRegex-OPTIONAL": "\\b(staging|preview|test|dev)\\.", // If this regular expression IS matched, add that preamble
            "enableOnLocalhost": true     // By default, Disclaimers are not shown when testing locally. Add this to test your disclaimer.
        },


### 2016-05-13b

* Fixed a bug in the build configuration that allowed extra whitespace to be inserted in multi-line strings.  This whitespace could case the markdown formatter to treat the string as preformatted text and break, e.g., error messages.

### 2016-05-13

* Breaking changes:
  * Columns with the name `ced_aec` are no longer supported for region mapping.  Please use `com_elb_code` or `com_elb_name` instead.
* Added new region types for region mapping:
  * Commonwealth electoral divisions 2016 by ID, from the Australian Electoral Commission: (column names: `divisionnm`, `com_elb_name_2016`, or `com_elb_name`)
  * Commonwealth electoral divisions 2016 by name, from the Australian Electoral Commission: (column names: `divisionid`, `com_elb_code_2016`, `com_elb_code`, or `com_elb`)
  * Natural resource management regions by ID (column names: `nrmr`, `nrmr_code`, or `nrmr_code_2011`)
  * Natural resource management regions by name (column name: `nrmr_name`)
  * Australian drainage divisions by ID (column names: `add`, `add_code`, `add_code_2011`)
  * Australian drainage divisions by name (column name: `add_name`)
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 3.1.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Injected clicked lat and long into templates under `{{terria.coords.latitude}}` and `{{terria.coords.longitude}}`.
  * Fixed an exception being thrown when selecting a region while another region highlight was still loading.
  * Added `CesiumTerrainCatalogItem` to display a 3D surface model in a supported Cesium format.
  * Added support for configuration of how time is displayed on the timeline - catalog items can now specify a dateFormat hash
      in their configuration that has formats for `timelineTic` (what is displayed on the timeline itself) and `currentTime`
      (which is the current time at the top-left).
  * Fixed display when `tableStyle.colorBins` is 0.
  * Added `fogSettings` option to init file to customize fog settings, introduced in Cesium 1.16.
  * Improved zooming to csvs, to include a small margin around the points.
  * Support ArcGIS MapServer extents specified in a wider range of projections, including GDA MGA zones.
  * WMS legends now use a bigger font, include labels, and are anti-aliased when we can determine that the server is Geoserver and supports these options.
  * Added support for time-series data sets with gaps - these are skipped when scrubbing on the timeline or playing.
  * Only trigger a search when the user presses enter or stops typing for 3 seconds.  This will greatly reduce the number of times that searches are performed, which is important with a geocoder like Bing Maps that counts each geocode as a transaction.
  * Reduced the tendency for search to lock up the web browser while it is in progress.
  * For WMS catalog items that have animated data, the initial time of the timeslider can be specified with `initialTimeSource` as `start`, `end`, `present` (nearest date to present), or with an ISO8601 date.
  * Added ability to remove csv columns from the Now Viewing panel, using `"type": "HIDDEN"` in `tableStyle.columns`.
  * Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.20.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
      * Fixed loading for KML `NetworkLink` to not append a `?` if there isn't a query string.
      * Fixed handling of non-standard KML `styleUrl` references within a `StyleMap`.
      * Fixed issue in KML where StyleMaps from external documents fail to load.
      * Added translucent and colored image support to KML ground overlays
      * `GeoJsonDataSource` now handles CRS `urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4326`
      * Fix a race condition that would cause the terrain to continue loading and unloading or cause a crash when changing terrain providers. [#3690](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3690)
      * Fix issue where the `GroundPrimitive` volume was being clipped by the far plane. [#3706](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3706)
      * Fixed a reentrancy bug in `EntityCollection.collectionChanged`. [#3739](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3739)
      * Fixed a crash that would occur if you added and removed an `Entity` with a path without ever actually rendering it. [#3738](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3738)
      * Fixed issue causing parts of geometry and billboards/labels to be clipped. [#3748](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3748)
      * Fixed bug where transparent image materials were drawn black.
      * Fixed `Color.fromCssColorString` from reusing the input `result` alpha value in some cases.
### 2016-05-15
* Detect when an old version of Node.js is being used, and fail helpfully.

### 2016-04-15

* Updated the URLs for the Water Observations from Space datasets to `geoserver.nci.org.au`.
* Split catalog into a separate module. The catalog is now managed through github.com/TerriaJS/NationalMap-Catalog.
* Split client-side configuration (config.json) from server-side (devserverconfig.json). Using Terria-Server 2.0.0 enables
  the catalog separation described above.
* Added missing CED2 regionmap id file.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 2.3.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Share links now contain details about the picked point, picked features and currently selected feature.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause catalog items to be loaded multiple times.
  * Added support for the `copyrightText` property for ArcGIS layers - this now shows up in info under "Copyright Text".
  * Showed a message in the catalog item info panel that informs the user that a catalog item is local and can't be shared.
  * TerriaJS now obtains its list of domains that the proxy will proxy for from the `proxyableDomains/` service.  The URL can be overridden by setting `parameters.proxyableDomainsUrl` in `config.json`.
  * Improved legend and coloring of ENUM (string) columns of CSV files, to sort first by frequency, then alphabetically.

### 2016-03-29

* Use terriajs-server 1.4.1 to fix a bug that caused all headers - even the ones meant to be excluded - to be passed to the remote server by the proxy service.  This broke the Western Australian Government datasets in the Geoscience Australia deployment architecture.

### 2016-03-15

* Updated "Population Estimates" layer to point to new GA location.
* Changed the query of the South Australian Government CKAN server to include datasets with a format of both `geojson` and `GeoJSON`, greatly increasing the number of datasets found.
* Updated all Geoscience Australia layers to point to the new infrastructure at http://services.ga.gov.au/gis/rest/services .
* Re-populated Western Australian Government group, now pulling directly from `catalogue.beta.data.wa.gov.au`.
* Added pages for HTTP 404 (Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error).  Previously, we redirected errors back to the main page without an explanation.
* Added Brisbane City Council group under Data Providers.
* Added direct download links for several ABS national boundaries.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 2.2.0.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Warn user when the requested WMS layer doesn't exist, and try to provide a suggestion.
  * Fixed the calculation of a CSV file's extent so that missing latitudes and longitudes are ignored, not treated as zero.
  * Improved the user experience around uploading files in a format not directly supported by TerriaJS and optionally using the conversion service.
  * Improved performance of large CSV files, especially the loading time, and the time taken to change the display variable of region-mapped files.
  * Added support for CSV files with only location (lat/lon or region) columns, and no value columns, using a file-specific color. Revised GeoJSON display to draw from the same palette of colors.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented GeoJSON styles from being applied correctly in some cases.
  * Fixed an error when adding a CSV with one line of data.
  * Fixed error when adding a CSV file with numeric column names.
  * Polygons and polylines are now highlighted on click when the geometry is available.
  * Improved legend and coloring of ENUM (string) columns of CSV files; only the most common values are colored differently, with the rest shown as 'Other'.
  * Changed `tableStyle`'s `format` to only accept `useGrouping`, `maximumFractionDigits` and `styling: "percent"` options. Previously some other options may have worked in some browsers.
  * Improved color palette for string (ENUM) columns of CSV files.
  * Improved CSV loading to ignore any completely blank lines after the header row (ie. lines which do not even have commas).
  * Added support for grouping catalog items retrieved from a CSW server according to criteria specified in the init file (via the `metadataGroups` property) or from a `domainSpecification` and a call to the `GetDomain` service on the CSW server.
  * Improved ABS display (to hide the regions) when a concept is deselected.
  * Improved readability of ArcGIS catalog items and legends by replacing underscores with spaces.
  * `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` metadata is now cached by the proxy for only 24 hours.
  * Improved the feature info panel to update the display of time-varying region-mapped CSV files for the current time.
  * Fixed sharing of time-varying CZML files; the timeline was not showing on the shared link.
  * Fixed sharing of user-added time-varying CSV files.
  * Fixed a bug in `CkanCatalogItem` that made it build URLs incorrectly when given a base URL ending in a slash.
  * Added column-specific styling to CSV files, using a new `tableStyle.columns` json parameter. This is an object whose keys are column names or indices, and whose values are objects of column-specific tableStyle parameters. See the CSV column-specific group in `wwwroot/test/init/test-tablestyle.json` for an example. [#1097](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/issues/1097)
  * Added the following column-specific `tableStyle` parameters:
    - `name`: renames the column.
    - `type`: sets the column type; can be one of LON, LAT, ALT, TIME, SCALAR, or ENUM.
    - `format`: sets the column number format, using the format of the [Javascript Intl options parameter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString), eg. `{"format": {"useGrouping": true, "maximumFractionDigits": 2}}` to add thousands separators to numbers and show only two decimal places. Only the `useGrouping`, `maximumFractionDigits` and `styling: "percent"` options are guaranteed to work in all browsers.
  * Added column-specific formatting to the feature info panel for all file types, eg. `"featureInfoTemplate" : {"template": "{{SPEED}} m/s", "formats": {"SPEED": {"maximumFractionDigits": 2}}}`. The formatting options are the same as above.
  * Changed the default number format in the Feature Info Panel to not separate thousands with commas.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the content on the feature info panel to be rendered as pure HTML instead of as mixed HTML / Markdown.
  * Changed the default for `tableStyle.replaceWithZeroValues` to `[]`, ie. nothing.
  * Changed the default for `tableStyle.replaceWithNullValues` to `["-", "na", "NA"]`.
  * Changed the default for `tableStyle.nullLabel` to '(No value)'.
  * Fixed showWarnings in config json not being respected by CSV catalog items.
  * Fixed hidden region mapped layers being displayed when variable selection changes.
  * Fixed exporting raw data as CSV not escaping commas in the data itself.
  * Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.18.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
    * Improved terrain performance by up to 35%. Added support for fog near the horizon, which improves performance by rendering less terrain tiles and reduces terrain tile requests. [#3154](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3154)
    * Reduced the amount of GPU and CPU memory used by terrain by using compression. The CPU memory was reduced by up to 40%, and approximately another 25% in Chrome.
    * Fixed an issue where the sun texture is not generated correctly on some mobile devices. [#3141](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/3141)
    * Cesium now honors window.devicePixelRatio on browsers that support the CSS imageRendering attribute. This greatly improves performance on mobile devices and high DPI displays by rendering at the browser-recommended resolution. This also reduces bandwidth usage and increases battery life in these cases.

### 2016-02-15

* Removed the datasets in the "ACT Government" and "Western Australian Government" groups because they were not working.  ACT broke as a result of a change in the Socrata software used to manage their catalog in January.  WA broke as a result of the retirement of Google Maps Engine in December.
* Several catalog items (`Mobile Black Spot Database` and `Mobile Black Spot Programme - Funded Base Stations` in `Communications`, `Catchment Scale Land Use 2015` in `Land`, and `Taxation Statistics 2011-201` and `Medicare Offices` in `Social and Economic`) now point directly to the corresponding dataset on data.gov.au and get their metadata from there, instead of pointing to a WMS server or GeoJSON file.
* The Australian Goverernment logos have been moved to the top-left part of the About page.
* References to "NICTA" have been replaced by "Data61" in the help pages.
* The privacy policy link on the Privacy page now links to the policy on `dpmc.gov.au` instead of `communications.gov.au`.
* The statistical boundary catalogue items now have direct download links to the ABS-provided shapefiles on their info pages.
* The `National Data Sets -> Elevation -> SRTM 1 sec DEM Image` catalogue item now points to the new service at `services.ga.gov.au` instead of the old one at `www.ga.gov.au`.
* Added the 2013 versions of the Local Government Area (LGA), Commonwealth Electoral Division (CED), and Tourism Regions (TR) boundaries for region mapping.
* The data source editor, previously at `terria.io/DataSourceEditor` is now available with NationalMap at `/editor`.  This way it will track the version of the catalogue format currently used by NationalMap.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 2.0.1.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Region mapping now works with CSV files containing a postcode column in which the leading zero is missing (e.g. `830` instead of `0830`).
  * Clicking inside a region with no value in a region-mapped CSV will now report "No features found" instead of showing a mysterious blank feature info window.
  * More date formats are now supported in CSV files, including `YYYY`, `YYYY-MM`, and `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM(:SS)`
  * Improved the formatting of dates/times from CSV files in the feature info panel.
  * Added 5 new options to the `tableStyle` property for CSV catalog items, including `replaceWithZeroValues`, `replaceWithNullValues`, `nullColor`, `nullLabel`, and `timeColumn`.  See the TerriaJS changelog linked above for details.
  * CSV columns containing only HTML tags are no longer shown as a possible Data Variable on the Now Viewing tab.
  * Greatly improved backward compatibility for share links.  Share links can now continue to work even if an enabled catalog item is moved or renamed.
  * We now generate a nice legend image for ArcGIS MapServer catalogue items instead of simply providing a link to the server-provided HTML file.
  * Legends for CSV, ABS, and ArcGIS MapServer catalogue items are now generated in SVG format.
  * Added `CkanCatalogItem`, which can be used to reference a particular resource of any compatible type on a CKAN server.
  * Fixed Leaflet feature selection when zoomed out enough that the world is repeated.
  * Improved the handling of lat/lon CSV files with missing latitude or longitude values.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented `SocrataCatalogGroup` from working in Internet Explorer 9.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the Now Viewing tab to display incorrectly in Internet Explorer 11 when switching directly to it from the Data Catalogue tab.

### 2016-01-19

* Fixed incorrect claims in the documentation that NationalMap was funed by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.

### 2016-01-15

* Removed `National Data Sets -> Land -> Catchment Scale Land Use 2014`.
* Removed hardcoded descriptions from the Mobile Black Spot datasets, allowing descriptions provided by the server to be used instead.
* Split out server-side code into a separate repo, github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs-server and NPM package 'terriajs-server'.
* Remove Supervisor and Forever, as they're basically redundant.
* Reworked "npm start" and "npm stop" so they start/stop TerriaJS-Server in the background.
* The disclaimer no longer overlaps with the map credits when printing the 2D view in Chrome.
* Fixed the City of Melbourne datasets.  An upgrade of their Socrata server broke functionality we relied on.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.53.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a typo that prevented clearing the search query on the Search tab.
  * Added a progress bar to the top of the map, indicating tile download progress.
  * We no longer show the entity's ID (which is usually a meaningless GUID) on the feature info panel when the feature does not have a name.  Instead, we leave the area blank.
  * Fixed a bug with time-dynamic imagery layers that caused features to be picked from the next time to be displayed, in addition to the current one.
  * `Cesium.zoomTo` now takes the terrain height into account when zooming to a rectangle.
  * Dramatically improved the performance of region mapping.
  * Introduced new quantisation (color binning) methods to dramatically improve the display of choropleths (numerical quantities displayed as colors) for CSV files, instead of always using linear. Four values for `colorBinMethod` are supported:
    * "auto" (default), usually means "ckmeans"
    * "ckmeans": use "CK means" method, an improved version of Jenks Even Breaks to form clusters of values that are as distinct as possible.
    * "quantile": use quantiles, evenly distributing values between bins
    * "none": use the previous linear color mapping method.
  * The default style for CSV files is now 7 color bins with CK means method.
  * Added support for color palettes from Color Brewer (colorbrewer2.org). Within `tableStyle`, use a value like `"colorPalette": "10-class BrBG"`.
  * Improved the display of legends for CSV files.
  * Added support for the Socrata "new backend" with GeoJSON download to `SocrataCatalogGroup`.
  * Improved compatibility with Internet Explorer 9.

### 2015-12-15

* Added Department of Environment datasets under `National Data Sets -> Environment`.
* Added Soil and Landscape Grid data under `National Data Sets -> Land`.
* Add NEII Viewer and AURIN Map to Related Maps.
* Fixed display of map preview images in Related Maps.
* Fixed the squished images on the Related Maps panel.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.50.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that caused poor performance when clicking a point on the map with lots of features and then closing the feature information panel.
  * Legend URLs are now accessed via the proxy, if applicable.
  * Fixed a bug that caused a `TypeError` on load when the share URL included enabled datasets with an order different from their order in the catalog.
  * Improved the message that is shown to the user when their browser supports WebGL but it has a "major performance caveat".
  * Fixed a bug that could cause an exception in some browsers (Internet Explorer, Safari) when loading a GeoJSON with embedded styles.
  * Fixed a bug with Leaflet 2D map where clicks on animation controls or timeline would also register on the map underneath causing undesired feature selection and, when double clicked, zooming (also removed an old hack that disabled dragging while using the timeline slider)
  * Changed Australian Topography base map server and updated the associated thumbnail.
  * Added `updateApplicationOnMessageFromParentWindow` function.  After an app calls this function at startup, TerriaJS can be controlled by its parent window when embedded in an `iframe` by messages sent with `window.postMessage`.
  * Put a white background behind legend images to fix legend images with transparent background being nearly invisible.
  * Search entries are no longer duplicated for catalog items that appear in multiple places in the Data Catalogue
  * Fixed the layer order changing in Cesium when a CSV variable is chosen.
  * Layer name is now shown in the catalog item info panel for ESRI ArcGIS MapServer layers.
  * Retrieve WFS or WCS URL associated with WMS data sources using DescribeLayer if no dataUrl is present.
  * Sorted ABS age variables numerically, not alphabetically.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented region mapping from working over HTTPS.
  * The proxy is now used to avoid a mixed content warning when accessing an HTTP dataset from an HTTPS deployment of TerriaJS.

### 2015-11-16

* Completely support the [csv-geo-au](https://github.com/NICTA/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au) specification (other than SA1s and boundaries from previous years) including ASGS boundaries like remoteness regions, indigenous areas and non ASGS boundaries like primary health networks.
* Added freight route datasets provided by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development under `Transport -> Freight`.
* Added IMOS and AODN Geoservers to the list of hosts that may be proxied.
* Changed the support email address from `nationalmap@communications.gov.au` to `data@pmc.gov.au`.
* Use YouTube videos hosted in the AusGovDPMC account.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.48.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Update the default Australian topography basemap to Geoscience Australia's new worldwide layer (http://www.ga.gov.au/gisimg/rest/services/topography/National_Map_Colour_Basemap/MapServer)
  * The Feature Info panel now shows all selected features in an accordion control.  Previously it only showed the first one.
  * Major refactor of `CsvCatalogItem`, splitting region-mapping functionality out into `RegionProvider` and `RegionProviderList`. Dozens of new test cases. In the process, fixed a number of bugs and added new features including:
    * Regions can be matched using regular expressions, enabling matching of messy fields like local government names ("Baw Baw", "Baw Baw Shire", "Baw Baw (S)", "Shire of Baw Baw" etc).
    * Regions can be matched using a second field for disambiguation (eg, "Campbelltown" + "SA")
    * Drag-and-dropped datasets with a time column behave much better: rather than a fixed time being allocated to each row, each row occupies all the time up until the next row is shown.
    * Enumerated fields are colour coded in lat-long files, consist with region-mapped files.
    * Feedback is now provided after region mapping, showing which regions failed to match, and which matched more than once.
    * Bug: Fields with names starting with 'lon', 'lat' etc were too aggressively matched.
    * Bug: Numeric codes beginning with zeros (eg, certain NT 08xx postcodes) were treated as numbers and failed to match.
    * Bug: Fields with names that could be interpreted as regions weren't available as data variables.
  * The `LocationBarViewModel` now shows the latitude and longitude coordinates of the mouse cursor in 2D as well as 3D.
  * The `LocationBarViewModel` no longer displays a misleading elevation of 0m when in "3D Smooth" mode.
  * Applied markdown to properties shown in the Feature Info Panel.
  * HTML and Markdown text in catalog item metadata, feature information, etc. is now formatted in a more typical way.  For example, text inside `<h1>` now looks like a heading.  Previously, most HTML styling was stripped out.
  * The `name` of a feature from a CSV file is now taken from a `name` or `title` column, if it exists.  Previously the name was always "Site Data".
  * Most catalog items now automatically expose a `dataUrl` that is the same as their `url`.
  * Fixed a bug that caused time-dynamic WMS layers with just one time to not be displayed.
  * Underscores are now replaced with spaces in the feature info panel for `GeoJsonCatalogItem`.
  * Added Proj4 projections to the location bar. Clicking on the bar switches between lats/longs and projected coordinates. To enable this, set `useProjection` to `true`
  * Fixed a bug that caused an exception when running inside an `<iframe>` and the user's browser blocked 3rd-party cookies.
  * Fixed a bug that caused `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` to incorrectly populate the catalog item's metadata with data from GetCapabilities when another layer had a `Title` with the same value as the expected layer's `Name`.
  * Avoid mixed content warnings when using the CartoDB basemaps.
  * Handle WMS time interval specifications (time/time and time/time/periodicity)
  * Allow a single layer of an ArcGIS MapServer to be added through the "Add Data" interface.
  * Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.15.  Significant changes relevant to TerriaJS users include:
    * Make KML invalid coordinate processing match Google Earth behavior. [#3124](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3124)
    * Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2271)
    * Fixed issues causing the terrain and sky to disappear when the camera is near the surface. [#2415](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2415) and [#2271](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2271)
    * Provided a workaround for Safari 9 where WebGL constants can't be accessed through `WebGLRenderingContext`. Now constants are hard-coded in `WebGLConstants`. [#2989](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/issues/2989)
    * Added a workaround for Chrome 45, where the first character in a label with a small font size would not appear. [#3011](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3011)
    * Fixed an issue with drill picking at low frame rates that would cause a crash. [#3010](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/3010)

### 2015-10-15

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.44.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that could cause timeseries animation to "jump" when resuming play after it was paused.
  * When catalog items are enabled, the checkbox now animates to indicate that loading is in progress.
  * Add `mode=preview` option in the hash portion of the URL.  When present, it is assumed that TerriaJS is being used as a previewer and the "small screen warning" will not be shown.
  * Added the `attribution` property to catalog items.  The attribution is displayed on the map when the catalog item is enabled.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented `AbsIttCatalogGroup` from successfully loading its list of catalog items.
  * Allow missing URLs on embedded data (eg. embedded czml data)
  * Fixed a bug loading URLs for ArcGIS services names that start with a number.
* Updated to [Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org) 1.13.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * The default `CTRL + Left Click Drag` mouse behavior is now duplicated for `CTRL + Right Click Drag` for better compatibility with Firefox on Mac OS [#2913](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/2913).
  * Fixed an issue where non-feature nodes prevented KML documents from loading. [#2945](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/pull/2945)

### 2015-09-17

* Improved proxy cache expiration.  Previously, catalog item tiles could be cached by end-user browsers much longer than intended.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.43.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented the opened/closed state of groups from being preserved when sharing.

### 2015-09-03

* Removed "beta" tag
* Added new screenshots and YouTube videos.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.42. Relevant changes include:
  * Fixed a bug sharing CSV items.

### 2015-08-03

* Retired the NICTA-hosted geotopo250k data sets, replacing them with the Geoscience Australia Topography data sets.
* Removed the Topography group under Data Providers.
* Added URL shortening in the share popup, and support launch with shortened URLs.
* Added support for proxying POST requests to the proxy service.
* Populated ACT Government group by querying the ACT Socrata server.
* Added City of Melbourne and Sunshine Coast Council (QLD) to the Data Providers group.
* Added selection of region type (e.g. SA2) for ABS datasets to the Now Viewing tab.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.41.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * `CsvCatalogItem` can now have no display variable selected, in which case all points are the same color.
  * Added `CswCatalogGroup` for populating a catalog by querying an OGC CSW service.
  * Fixed a bug that prevented WMTS layers with a single `TileMatrixSetLink` from working correctly.
  * Added support for WMTS layers that can only provide tiles in JPEG format.
  * Fixed testing and caching of ArcGIS layers from tools and added More information option for imagery layers.
  * Made polygons drastically faster in 2D.
  * Added Google Analytics reporting of the application URL.  This is useful for tracking use of share URLs.
  * Added the ability to specify a specific dynamic layer of an ArcGIS Server using just a URL.
  * Fixed a race condition in `AbsIttCatalogItem` that could cause the legend and map to show different state than the Now Viewing UI suggested.
  * Fixed a bug where an ABS concept with a comma in its name (e.g. "South Eastern Europe,nfd(c)" in Country of Birth) would cause values for concept that follow to be misappropriated to the wrong concepts.
  * `ArcGisMapServerCatalogItem` now shows "NoData" tiles by default even after showing the popup message saying that max zoom is exceeded.  This can be disabled by setting its `showTilesAfterMessage` property to false.

### 2015-07-19

* Default to 2D on common mobile devices in order to make the app more performant, especially on older mobile devices.
* Significantly improved the experience on devices with small screens, such as phones.
* Start with the Data Catalogue panel hidden on devices with small screens.
* Switched the "Commonwealth Electoral Divisions" dataset to use the official boundaries from the Australia Electoral Commission.  Previously it used the Australian Bureau of Statistics versions.
* Additional ABS region support.  Now supported internally: AUS,STE,CED,SED,POA,LGA,SA4,SA1,SA2,SA1. Datasets exposing all of these are not yet available.
* The South Australian Government group is now populated by querying the SA CKAN server for GeoJSON and csv-geo-au resources.
* Use `mybroadband:` layers instead of `public:` layers for Broadband datsets.
* Access the Mobile Black Spot Programme datasets via WMS instead of CSV.
* Improved the look and feel of the Help and About pages.
* The elevation value displayed in the lower right corner is now a height above mean sea level (above the EGM96 geoid specifically) instead of a height above the WGS84 ellipsoid.
* Added two new base map options, both from CartoDB: Positron and Dark Matter.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.36.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that caused the 3D view to use significant CPU time even when idle.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the popup message to appear twice when a dataset failed to load.
  * Calculate extent of TopoJSON files so that the viewer correctly pans+zooms when a TopoJSON file is loaded.

  * Added layer information to the Info popup for WMS datasets.
  * Polygons from GeoJSON datasets are now filled.
  * Left-aligned feature info table column and added some space between columns.
  * Added support for styling GeoJSON files, either in catalog (add .style{} object) or embedded directly in the file following the [SimpleStyle spec](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented catalog items inside groups on the Search tab from being enabled.
  * Added support for discovering GeoJSON datasets from CKAN.
  * Added support for zipped GeoJSON files.

  * `CatalogItem.zoomTo` can now zoom to much smaller bounding box rectangles.
  * Upgraded to Cesium 1.11.

### 2015-07-03

* Changed the support email address from `nationalmap@lists.nicta.com.au` to `nationalmap@communications.gov.au`.
* Renamed "Gravity Image" to "Gravity Anomaly" and updated it to load from the new server (the old one is deprecated).
* Renamed "Magnetic Image" to "Magnetic Intensity" and updated it to load from the new server (the old one is deprecated).
* Updated the layer name used to access "SRTM 1 sec DEM Image".  The old one worked but was not advertised in the WMS server's GetCapabilities, which limited the quality of the metadata.
* The Data.gov.au group now includes CKAN resources with the `csv-geo-au` format.
* Improved the metadata, including descriptions and licence information, for many of the data sets in National Data Sets.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.32.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Numerous changes to improve the quality of the catalogue item info page.
  * Added support for `csv-geo-*` (e.g. csv-geo-au) to `CkanCatalogGroup`.
  * `CkanCatalogGroup` now fills the `dataUrl` property of created items by pointing to the dataset's page on CKAN.
  * The catalog item information panel now displays `info` sections in a consistent order.  The order can be overridden by setting `CatalogItemInfoViewModel.infoSectionOrder`.
  * An empty `description` or `info` section is no longer shown on the catalog item information panel.  This can be used to remove sections that would otherwise be populated from dataset metadata.

### 2015-06-24

* Updated the favicon.
* Switched the new Medicare Offices dataset to load directly from data.gov.au.

### 2015-06-23

* Fixed the URL of the Roboto Mono font so that it downloads correctly even over `https`.
* Improved the styling of the About page.
* Fixed an incorrect link to the About page from the disclaimer at the bottom of the map.
* The nm.json file is now created at build time from a number of initialization files in the `datasources` directory.  The individual files are easier to manage and edit than a single large file.
* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.27.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed incorrect date formatting in the timeline and animation controls on Internet Explorer 9.
  * Added support for CSV files with longitude and latitude columns but no numeric value column.  Such datasets are visualized as points with a default color and do not have a legend.
  * The Feature Information popup is now automatically closed when the user changes the `AbsIttCatalogItem` filter.
  * `WebMapServiceCatalogItem` now determines its rectangle from the GetCapabilities metadata even when configured to use multiple WMS layers.
  * `AbsIttCatalogItem` styles can now be set using the `tableStyle` property, much like `CsvCatalogItem`.
  * Improved `AbsIttCatalogItem`'s tolerance of errors from the server.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the brand bar to slide away with the explorer panel on Internet Explorer 9.

### 2015-06-16

* Updated to [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs) 1.0.23.  Significant changes relevant to NationalMap users include:
  * Fixed a bug that prevented features from being pickable from ABS datasets on the 2D map.
  * Fixed a bug that caused the Explorer Panel tabs to be missing or misaligned in Firefox.
  * Changed to use JPEG instead of PNG format for the Natural Earth II basemap.  This makes the tile download substantially smaller.

  * Esri ArcGIS MapServers can now be added via the "Add Data" panel.
  * We now support discovery of ArcGIS MapServer "Raster Layers" in addition to "Feature Layers".
  * Sharing now preserves the base map and view mode (2D/3D) selection.
  * Improved error handling in `CzmlCatalogItem`, `GeoJsonCatalogItem`, and `KmlCatalogItem`.
  * We now raise an error and hide the dataset when asked to show a layer in Leaflet and that layer does not use the Web Mercator (EPSG:3857) projection. Previously, the dataset would silently fail to display.
  * Fixed a bug that caused Internet Explorer 8 users to see a blank page instead of a message saying their browser is incompatible.

### 2015-05-15

* Dataset changes:
  * Added New South Wales Government
  * Added National Data Sets -> Surface Water -> Water Observations from Space
  * Added National Data Sets -> Social and Economic -> Housing Stress
  * Data Providers -> Water (Bureau of Meteorology Geofabric) now has sensible groups instead of a flat list.
* National Map is now built on [TerriaJS](http://www.github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs).  See the [changelog](https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs/blob/1.0.11/CHANGES.md) for the complete list of changes since TerriaJS split off from National Map.  Significant changes relevant to National Map users include:
  * The Search tab now searches the names of all datasets in the catalogue, including those in delay-loaded groups.
  * The 2D view once again correctly shows imagery attribution.
  * The catalog item info page now renders a much more complete set of Markdown and HTML elements.
  * Added support for region mapping based on region names instead of region numbers (example in `wwwroot/test/countries.csv`).
  * Added support for time-dynamic region mapping (example in `wwwroot/test/droughts.csv`).
  * Added the ability to region-map countries (example in `wwwroot/test/countries.csv`).
  * Esri ArcGIS MapServer datasets now show much more information when the user clicks the Info button.
  * Improved the appearance of the legends generating with region mapping.
  * Fixed a bug that caused features to be picked from all layers in an Esri MapServer, instead of just the visible ones.
  * Added support for the WMS MinScaleDenominator property and the Esri MapServer maxScale property, preventing layers using these properties from disappearing when zoomed in to close to the surface.
  * Fixed a bug that could cause the "Drop a data file anywhere" message to get stuck on when dragging a file over the application while a modal dialog was open.
  * Elminated distracting "jumping" of the selection indicator when picking point features while zoomed in very close to the surface.
  * The 3D viewer now shows Bing Maps imagery unmodified, matching the 2D viewer. Previously, it applied a gamma correction.
  * Polygons loaded from KML files are now placed on the terrain surface.
  * We no longer automatically fly to the first location when pressing Enter in the Search input box, because this was surprising and often didn't work well.
  * Checkboxes in the Data Catalogue and Search tabs now have a larger clickable area, which is especially helpful on touch screens.
  * The Feature Information functionality now works with servers that can only return HTML, and displays it appropriately.  This is especially useful for Google Maps Engine (GME) WMS servers.
* The Bing Maps API key can now be specified in config.json.

### 2015-04-15

* Upgraded to Cesium 1.8.  See the [changelog](https://github.com/AnalyticalGraphicsInc/cesium/blob/1.8/CHANGES.md) for details.

* Fixed a bug that prevented WFS datasets from working in Internet Explorer 10 and Safari.

### 2015-03-26

* Greatly enhanced support for ArcGIS servers.  ArcGIS map servers can now be queried for their list of layers to populate the Data Catalogue, and they can provide metadata information when clicking a feature on the map.
* Added features to the Tools panel (accessible by visiting http://nationalmap.nicta.com.au/#tools=1) to test datasets.
* Added the "Broadband ADSL Availability" and "Broadband ADSL Availability no Borders" datasets to the catalogue under Communications.  Also fixed a typo in the name of "Broadband Availability no Borders".
