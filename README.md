# NationalMap

[NationalMap](https://nationalmap.gov.au) is a website for map-based access to Australian spatial data from government agencies. It is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's [Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet](http://www.dpmc.gov.au/) and the software has been developed by [Data61](http://www.csiro.au/en/Research/D61) (formerly NICTA) working closely with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, [Geoscience Australia](http://www.ga.gov.au/) and other government agencies.

NationalMap is designed to:

- Provide easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and public
- Facilitate the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies
- Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation

NationalMap is powered by [TerriaJS](https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaJS), a free, open source geospatial catalog viewer.

## Want to make your own Terria Map?

Start your map from https://github.com/TerriaJS/TerriaMap, which is maintained as a starting point for third-party maps, without NationalMap branding.

See the [TerriaMap documentation](https://terria.io/Documentation/) for more detailed information about Terria and how to build and run it.

**Note:** while NationalMap is no longer maintained as a separate branch of TerriaMap, it is functionally identical to TerriaMap. It is developed in [simple-saas-terria-map](https://github.com/TerriaJS/simple-saas-terria-map) and released from [saas](https://github.com/TerriaJS/saas).
