      <h1>About NationalMap</h1>
      <p>NationalMap, together with <a href="https://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a> are essential mechanisms in the implementation of Australian Government’s <a href="https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/public-data/australian-government-public-data-policy-statement">Open Data Policy</a>, for open data publication, discovery and consumption by government, industry, research, community organisations and the general public.</p>
      <p>Since the 2014 launch of NationalMap, the number of datasets being made accessible has grown to over 13,000, federated from more than 50 data custodians, from all levels of government across Australia.</p>
      <p>In 2021, NationalMap has reached more than 30,000 thousand user sessions per month, meeting user’s needs for geospatial data and the insight it unlocks for a wide range of activities and benefits. These include enabling diagnostic tasks, facilitating research dissemination, supporting private and commercial activities, enabling knowledge acquisition regardless of level of tech literacy, and communicating information and insight broadly for data driven decision making.</p>
      <p>Based on these usage patterns, 2020 projections of the net benefits to the Australian economy delivered by TerriaJS, the open source software powering NationalMap, are just over $47.5 Million for the 10-year period to 2028 (Centre for International Economics, 2019).</p>
      <p>Today National Map is managed by Geoscience Australia (GA) in collaboration with CSIRO’s Data61 for software development, hosting and data management. This is continuing the legacy of excellence in innovation and digital enablement of founding imitative partners, which included the Department of Communications and the Arts, the Department of Prime Minister & Cabinet and the Digital Transformation Agency.</p>
      <p><strong>NationalMap</strong> is an online map-based tool to allow easy access tospatial data from Australian government agencies and is based on a fully open architecture. When you access data through it, you are typically accessing the data directly from the government department or agency who are the custodians of that data.</p>
      <p><strong>NationalMap</strong>...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provides easy access to authoritative and other spatial data to government, business and the public</li>
        <li>facilitates the opening of data by federal, state and local government bodies</li>
        <li>provides an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To see what data is available on NationalMap, refer to the Data Catalogue in the <a href="/">NationalMap</a> itself. Click the <em>Add data</em> button and expand the datasets' group name.</p>

      <h2>Contributing Data to NationalMap</h2>
      <p>Spatial data sets which are placed on <a href="https://data.gov.au">data.gov.au</a> using supported data formats and protocols (such as WMS) will automatically be included in NationalMap.</p>
      <p>Australian government agencies that wish to find out more information about contributing data sets to NationalMap should email <a href="mailto:data@digital.gov.au">data@digital.gov.au</a> with their questions. Typically, NationalMap does not store the data itself, but refers to the data servers of the data contributors, directly taking that data and presenting it overlaid over a map. Therefore, agencies providing data directly must have the data available via an online server using a standard protocol.</p>

      <h2>NationalMap Software</h2>
      <p>The core components of NationalMap are Open Source software libraries available as Github projects. The core platform, <a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs">TerriaJS</a>, was initially developed by Data61 for NationalMap, but has subsequently been used for other projects. It has been made available to assist with the development of other spatial data viewing applications.</p>

      <h2>Additional Open Source Software Used</h2>
      <p>In developing NationalMap, Data61 has used open source software and contributed back to it. NationalMap leverages these excellent open source libraries:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/TerriaJS/terriajs">TerriaJS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://cesiumjs.org">Cesium</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The complete list is available with the NationalMap source code</p>
